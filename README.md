Trying to set up a nice dev environment to learn Node.js.  I am working through examples in the <a href="http://www.manning.com/cantelon/">_Node.js in Action_</a> book.  I also hope to explore some other ideas for playing with it from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js">Stackoverflow question</a>

I'm using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to spin up a version of Ubuntu Precise 32-bit to dev in.  The node\_js\_file.sh is the <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html">provision</a> to setup the machine for Node.js development.  I followed and modified <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager">these instructions</a> for the bash script.

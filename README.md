Trying to set up and nice dev environment to learn Node.js.  I am working through examples in the <a href="http://www.manning.com/cantelon/">_Node.js in Action_</a> book.  I also hope to explore some other ideas for playing with it from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js">Stackoverflow question</a>

I'm using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to spin up a version of Ubuntu Precise 32-bit to dev in.  The node\_js\_file.sh is the <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html">provision</a> to setup the machine for Node.js development.  I followed and modified <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager">these instructions</a> for the bash script.  


I'll try my best to add proper documentation to what I am doing.  I'm enjoying  and spinning up a little virtual machine for each coding thing I do.  It sounds tedious but it keeps my computer clean and can help others spin up a machine and use this code if they wanted to play with it.  

I'm gonna try to add the Vagrantfile and shellscript <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html">provisions</a> I use for each project/idea/whatev to help anyone who wants to fuss with my noobish code :).
